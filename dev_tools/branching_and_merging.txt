===================
= BRANCH creation =
===================

If you want to branch out from trunk's tip, refresh to trunk's tip
    cvs -q update -P -A -d (in directory E:\Projects\moduleName)

Check that everything runs properly, compiles, passes tests, ecc.

tag your checked-out version (NOT rtag, as this would tag the trunk's tip.
If you use wincvs try to select your module with the right button and select
'Create a tag on selection'). From command line it should look like
    cvs tag Root-Of-R000201a2 (in directory E:\Projects\moduleName)

now branch-tag your checked-out version
    cvs tag -b R000201a2-branch (in directory E:\Projects\moduleName)

Switch to your "branches" folder and check out the newly created branch
    cvs -q update -P -d -r R000201a2-branch (in directory E:\Branches\moduleName)


==================
= BRANCH MERGING =
==================
The following procedure do not take care of binary files: do it by hand!

The procedure assumes this is not the first branch-into-trunk merge.
If it is the first one you have to substitute any occurrence of
R000201a2-branch-merge2 with R000201a2-branch-merge1 and any occurrence of
R000201a2-branch-merge1 with Root-Of-R000201a2.

In the folder of the branch checked-out version, refresh to branch's tip:
    cvs -q update -P -d -r R000201a2-branch (in directory E:\Branches\moduleName)

Check that everything runs properly, compiles, passes tests, ecc.

tag this version (NOT rtag, as this would tag the trunk's tip.
If you use wincvs try to select your module with the right button and select
'Create a tag on selection')
    cvs tag R000201a2-branch-merge2 (in directory E:\Branches\moduleName)

check carefully what you are going to merge into truck
    cvs -q diff -r R000201a2-branch-merge1 -r R000201a2-branch-merge2

CHANGE BACK TO YOUR PROJECT FOLDER !!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
In the folder of the trunk checked out version, (remote)tag the trunk
    cvs rtag Before-R000201a2-branch-merge2 moduleName (in directory E:\Projects\moduleName)

refresh to trunk's tip
    cvs -q update -P -A -d (in directory E:\Projects\moduleName)

Merge the branch latest changes into trunk
    cvs -q update -kk -j R000201a2-branch-merge1 -j R000201a2-branch-merge2 (in directory E:\Projects\moduleName)

Resolve all conflicts (if any), then commit into trunk
    cvs -q commit -m "R000201a2-branch-merge2 merged into trunk" (in directory E:\Projects\moduleName)

Finally tag (NOT rtag) your version
    cvs tag After-R000201a2-branch-merge2 (in directory E:\Projects\moduleName)
