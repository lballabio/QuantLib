    <strong>Release 1.24 - October 2021</strong>

    PORTABILITY
    - Overhauled the CMake build system (thanks to Philip Kovacs).  Among
      other things, it now allows to specify the available configuration
      options from the `cmake` invocation and adds the required Boost
      libraries accordingly.

    INSTRUMENTS
    - Avoid callable-bond mispricing when a call date is close but not equal
      to a coupon date (thanks to Ralf Konrad for the fix and to GitHub user
      aichao for the analysis).
      See <https://github.com/lballabio/QuantLib/issues/930> for details.
    - A new `RiskyBondEngine` is available for bonds (thanks to Lew Wei
      Hao).  It prices bonds based on a risk-free discount cure and a
      default-probability curve used to assess the probability of each
      coupon payment.  It makes accessible to all bonds the calculations
      previously available in the experimental `RiskyBond` class.

    CASHFLOWS
    - The choice between par and indexed coupons was moved to
      `IborCouponPricer` (thanks to Peter Caspers).  This also made it
      possible to override the choice locally when building a
      `VanillaSwap` or a `SwapRateHelper`, so that coupons with both
      behaviors can now be used at the same time.

    TERM STRUCTURES
    - Cross-currency basis swap rate helpers now support both
      constant-notional and marked-to-market swaps (thanks to Marcin
      Rybacki).

    DATE/TIME
    - Added Chilean calendar (thanks to Anubhav Pandey).
    - Added new `ThirdWednesdayInclusive` date-generation rule that also
      adjusts start and end dates (thanks to Lew Wei Hao).

    PATTERNS
    - Overhauled `Singleton` implementation (thanks to Peter Caspers).
      Singletons are now initialized in a thread-safe way when sessions
      are enabled, global singletons (that is, independent of sessions)
      were made available, and static initialization was made safer.

    TEST SUITE
    - Sped up some of the longer-running tests (thanks to Mohammad Shojatalab).

    DEPRECATED FEATURES
    - Deprecated default constructor for the U.S. calendar; the desired
      market should now be passed explicitly.
    - Deprecated the `nominalTermStructure` method and the corresponding
      data member in inflation term structures.  Any object needing the
      nominal term structure should have it passed explicitly.
    - Deprecated the `termStructure_` data member in
      `BlackCalibrationHelper`.  It you're inheriting from
      `BlackCalibrationHelper` and need it, declare it in your derived
      class.
    - Deprecated the `createAtParCoupons`, `createIndexedCoupons` and
      `usingAtParCoupons` methods of `IborCoupon`, now moved to a new
      `IborCoupon::Settings` singleton (thanks to Philip Kovacs).
    - Deprecated the `conversionType` and `baseCurrency` static data
      members of `Money`, now moved to a new `Money::Settings` singleton
      (thanks to Philip Kovacs).
    - Removed features deprecated in version 1.19: the `BMAIndex`
      constructor taking a calendar, the `AmericanCondition` and
      `ShoutCondition` constructors taking an option type and strike, the
      `CurveDependentStepCondition` class and the
      `StandardCurveDependentStepCondition` typedef, the
      `BlackCalibrationHelper` constructor taking a yield term structure,
      the various inflation term structure constructors taking a yield
      term structure, the various yield term constructors taking a vector
      of jumps but not specifying a reference date.

    Thanks go also to Mickael Anas Laaouini, Jack Gillett, Bojan Nikolic
    and Klaus Spanderen for smaller fixes, enhancements and bug reports.

    <strong>Release 1.23 - July 14th, 2021</strong>

    PORTABILITY
    - On Mac OS, the `-std=c++11` flag is now added automatically when
      needed.  This applies to both `configure` and `cmake` (thanks to
      Leander Schulten).
    - We now assume that the compiler supports Boost::uBLAS and no longer
      check for it in configure.  (The check was originally introduced for
      versions of gcc before 4.x, which don't support C++ anyway.)
      Please let us know if this causes problems on some systems.
    - The `Period`, `InterestRate` and `InterestRateIndex` classes are now
      visualized more clearly in the Visual Studio debugger (thanks to
      Francois Botha).

    CASHFLOWS
    - Year-on-year and CPI legs are now set a default coupon pricer.  In
      most cases, this removes the need for setting it explicitly.
    - Add new `ZeroInflationCashFlow` class, used in zero-coupon inflation
      swaps (thanks to Ralf Konrad).

    CURRENCIES
    - Added custom constructor that allows to create bespoke currencies
      not already included in the library (thanks to Marcin Rybacki).

    DATE/TIME
    - Fixed implementation of U.S. 30/360 convention (the old one is still
      available as 30/360 NASD).
    - The 30/360 ISDA convention can now take the termination date as a
      constructor argument and use it to adjust the calculation properly.
    - Added the 30/360 ISMA convention; the Bond-Basis convention is now
      an alias to the former.
    - The 30/360 German convention was renamed to ISDA; "German" remains
      as an alias.
    - Added new Canadian holiday (National Day for Truth and
      Reconciliation) established in 2021 (thanks to GitHub user `qiubill`
      for the heads-up).
    - Added new U.S. holiday (Juneteenth) established in 2021.
    - Added new Platinum Jubilee U.K. holiday for 2022 (thanks to Ioannis
      Rigopoulos for the heads-up.)
    - Added missing Christmas Eve holiday to Norwegian calendar (thanks to
      Prince Nanda).

    INDEXES
    - Added ESTR index (thanks to Magnus Mencke).

    INSTRUMENTS
    - Added zero-coupon swap (thanks to Marcin Rybacki).
    - The `Type` enumeration defined in several swap classes was moved to
      their base `Swap` class.
    - Fixed sign of theta in experimental Kirk engine for spread options
      (thanks to Xu Ruilong for the heads-up).

    PROCESSES
    - Improved discretization of Cox-Ingersoll-Ross process to avoid
      occasional divergence (thanks to Magnus Mencke).

    DEPRECATED FEATURES
    - Deprecated default constructor for actual/actual and 30/360 day
      counters; the desired convention should now be passed explicitly.
    - Removed features deprecated in version 1.18: the
      `CalibrationHelperBase` typedef (now `CalibrationHelper`), some
      overloads of the `CalibratedModel::calibrate` and
      `CalibratedModel::value` methods, the constructors of
      `PiecewiseYieldCurve` and `PiecewiseDefaultCurve` taking an
      `accuracy` parameter, the constructors of `BondHelper`,
      `FixedRateBondHelper` and `CPIBondHelper` taking a boolean
      `useCleanPrice` parameter, the `BondHelper::useCleanPrice()` method,
      and the non-static `Calendar::holidayList` method.

    Thanks go also to Francis Duffy, Kevin Kirchhoff, Magnus Mencke and
    Klaus Spanderen for smaller fixes, enhancements and bug reports.

    <strong>Release 1.22 - April 15th, 2021</strong>

    PORTABILITY
    - As previously announced, this release drops support for Visual
      C++ 2012.  VC++ 2013 or later is now required.
    - The `Date` and `Array` classes are now visualized more clearly in
      the Visual Studio debugger (thanks to Francois Botha).

    LANGUAGE STANDARD
    - QuantLib now uses the C++11 standard and no longer compiles in C++03
      mode.  As before, it can be compiled with later versions of the
      standard.  For details on the C++11 features used, see the pull
      requests marked "C++11 modernization" at the above link; for
      information on possible problems, see
      <https://www.implementingquantlib.com/2021/02/leaving-03-for-real.html>.

    CASHFLOWS
    - Revised and tested the `SubPeriodCoupon` class (thanks to Marcin
      Rybacki).  The class was moved out of the `ql/experimental` folder
      and its interface can now be considered stable.
    - Add simple averaging to overnight-index coupons in addition to the
      existing compound averaging (thanks to Marcin Rybacki).
    - Fixed accrual calculation for inflation coupon when trading
      ex-coupon (thanks to GitHub user `bachhani`).

    CURRENCIES
    - Added the Nigerian Naira (thanks to Bryte Morio).

    DATE/TIME
    - Fixed actual/actual (ISMA) day counter calculation for long/short
      final periods (thanks to Francois Botha).
    - Updated a couple of changed rules for New Zealand calendar (thanks
      to Paul Giltinan).

    INDEXES
    - Added `hasHistoricalFixing` inspector to `Index` class to check if
      the fixing for a given past date is available (thanks to Ralf
      Konrad).

    INSTRUMENTS
    - Added new-style finite-difference engine for shout options (thanks
      to Klaus Spanderen).  In the case of dividend shout options, an
      escrowed dividend model is used.
    - Revised the `OvernightIndexFutures` class.  The class was moved out
      of the `ql/experimental` folder and its interface can now be
      considered stable.
    - Added an overloaded constructor for Asian options that takes all
      past fixings and thus allows to reprice them correctly when the
      evaluation date changes (thanks to Jack Gillett).
    - Added support for seasoned geometric Asian options to the Heston
      engine (thanks to Jack Gillett).

    PATTERNS
    - Faster implementation of the `Observable` class in the thread-safe
      case (thanks to Klaus Spanderen).

    TERM STRUCTURES
    - Added experimental rate helper for constant-notional cross-currency
      basis swaps (thanks to Marcin Rybacki).
    - Added volatility type and displacements to year-on-year inflation
      volatility surfaces (thanks to Peter Caspers).

    DEPRECATED FEATURES
    - Removed features deprecated in version 1.17: the `Callability::Type`
      typedef (now `Bond::Price`), the `FdmOrnsteinUhlenbackOp` typedef
      (now correctly spelled as `FdmOrnsteinUhlenbeckOp`, and a number of
      old-style finite-difference engines (`FDAmericanEngine`,
      `FDBermudanEngine`, `FDDividendAmericanEngine` and its variants,
      `FDDividendEuropeanEngine` and its variants, and `FDEuropeanEngine`)
      all replaced by the `FdBlackScholesVanillaEngine` class.
    - Deprecated the old-style finite difference engines for shout
      options; they are now replaced by the new `FDDividendShoutEngine`
      class.
    - Deprecated a few unused parts of the old-style finite-differences
      framework: the `AmericanCondition` class, the `OneFactorOperator`
      typedef, and the `FDAmericanCondition` class.

    TEST SUITE
    - Reduced the run time for the longest-running test cases.

    Thanks go also to Francis Duffy and Cay Oest for smaller fixes,
    enhancements and bug reports.

    <strong>Release 1.21 - January 20th, 2021</strong>

    PORTABILITY
    - As previously announced, this is the last release to support
      Visual C++ 2012.  Starting from next release, VC++ 2013 or later
      will be required in order to enable use of C++11 features.

    INSTRUMENTS
    - Improve date generation for CDS schedules under the post-big-bang
      rules (thanks to Francis Duffy).
    - Amortizing fixed-rate bonds can now use a generic `InterestRate`
      object (thanks to Piter Dias).
    - Added Monte Carlo pricer for discrete-average arithmetic Asian
      options under the Heston model (thanks to Jack Gillett).
    - Added analytic and Monte Carlo pricers for discrete-average
      geometric Asian options under the Heston model (thanks to Jack
      Gillett).  Together, they can also be used as a control variate in
      Monte Carlo models for arithmetic Asian options.
    - Added analytic pricer for continuous-average geometric Asian
      options under the Heston model (thanks to Jack Gillett).
    - Added analytic pricer for forward options under the Heston model
      (thanks to Jack Gillett).
    - Added Monte Carlo pricers for forward options under the
      Black-Scholes and the Heston models (thanks to Jack Gillett).

    TERM STRUCTURES
    - Added Dutch regulatory term structure, a.k.a. ultimate forward term
      structure (thanks to Marcin Rybacki).
    - Generalized exponential spline fitting to an arbitrary number of
      parameters; it is now also possible to fix kappa (thanks to David
      Sansom).
    - Fixed averaging period for 1-month SOFR futures rate helper (thanks
      to Eisuke Tani).

    DATE/TIME
    - Fixed a bug and added 2017 holidays in Thailand calendar (thanks to
      GitHub user `phil-zxx` for the heads-up).
    - Updated Chinese calendar for 2021 (thanks to Cheng Li).
    - Updated Japanese calendar for 2021 (thanks to Eisuke Tani).

    Thanks go also to Francois Botha, Peter Caspers, Ralf Konrad,
    Matthias Siemering, Klaus Spanderen and Joseph Wang for smaller
    fixes, enhancements and bug reports.

    <strong>Release 1.20 - October 26th, 2020</strong>

    PORTABILITY
    - Support for Visual C++ 2012 is being deprecated.  It will be dropped
      after the next release in order to enable use of C++11 features.
    - It is now possible to opt into using `std::tuple` instead of
      `boost::tuple` when the compiler allows it.  The default is still to
      use the Boost implementation.  The feature can be enabled by
      uncommenting the `QL_USE_STD_TUPLE` macro in `ql/userconfig.hpp` on
      Visual C++ or by passing the `--enable-std-tuple` switch to
      `./configure` on other systems.  The `--enable-std-tuple` switch is
      also implied by `--enable-std-classes`.  (Thanks to Joseph Wang.)

    INSTRUMENTS
    - Added mixing-factor parameter to Heston finite-differences barrier,
      rebate and double-barrier engines (thanks to GitHub user
      `jackgillett101`).
    - Added a few additional results to Black swaption engine and to
      analytic European option engine (thanks to Peter Caspers and Marcin
      Rybacki).
    - Improved calculation of spot date for vanilla swap around holidays
      (thanks to Paul Giltinan).
    - Added ex-coupon feature to amortizing bonds, callable bonds and
      convertible bonds.
    - Added optional first-coupon day counter to fixed-rate bonds (thanks
      to Jacob Lee-Howes).

    MATH
    - Added convenience classes `LogCubic` and `LogMixedLinearCubic`
      hiding a few default parameters (thanks to Andrea Maffezzoli).

    MODELS
    - Added control variate based on asymptotic expansion for the Heston
      model (thanks to Klaus Spanderen).

    DATE/TIME
    - Added missing Hong Kong holiday (thanks to GitHub user `CarrieMY`).
    - Added a couple of one-off closing days to the Romanian calendar.
    - Added a one-off holiday to South Korean calendar (thanks to GitHub
      user `fayce66`).
    - Added a missing holiday to Turkish calendar (thanks to Berat
      Postalcioglu).

    DOCUMENTATION
    - Added basic documentation to optimization methods (thanks to GitHub
      user `martinbrose`).

    DEPRECATED FEATURES
    - Features deprecate in version 1.16 were removed: a constructor of
      the `FdmOrnsteinUhlenbeckOp` class and a constructor of the
      `SwaptionVolatilityMatrix` class.

    <strong>Release 1.19 - July 20th, 2020</strong>

    PORTABILITY
    - Support for Visual C++ 2012 is being deprecated.  It will be dropped
      around the end of 2020 or the beginning of 2021 in order to enable
      use of C++11 features.
    - Avoided use in Makefiles of functions only available to GNU Make
      (thanks to GitHub user `UnitedMarsupials` for the heads-up).

    BUILD
    - Automated builds on Travis and GitHub Actions were extended.  We now
      have a build for Mac OS X, as well as a few builds that run a number
      of checks on the code (including clang-tidy) and automatically open
      pull requests with fixes.

    TERM STRUCTURES
    - Added options for iterative bootstrap to widen the search domain or
      to keep the best result upon failure (thanks to Francis Duffy).
    - Added flat-extrapolation option to fitted bond curves (thanks to
      Peter Caspers).

    INSTRUMENTS
    - Added finite-difference pricing engine for equity options under the
      Cox-Ingersoll-Ross process (thanks to Lew Wei Hao).
    - Added Heston engine based on exponentially-fitted Laguerre
      quadrature rule (thanks to Klaus Spanderen).
    - Added Monte Carlo pricing engines for lookback options (thanks to
      Lew Wei Hao).
    - Added Monte Carlo pricing engine for double-barrier options (thanks
      to Lew Wei Hao).
    - Added analytic pricing engine for equity options under the
      Vasicek model (thanks to Lew Wei Hao).
    - The `Bond::yield` method can now specify a guess and whether the
      passed price is clean or dirty (thanks to Francois Botha).

    MODELS
    - Improved grid scaling for FDM Heston SLV calibration, and fixed
      drift and diffusion for Heston SLV process (thanks to Klaus
      Spanderen and Peter Caspers).
    - Added mixing factor to Heston SLV process (thanks to Lew Wei Hao).

    MATH
    - Improved nodes/weights for the exponentially fitted Laguerre
      quadrature rule and added sine and cosine quadratures (thanks to
      Klaus Spanderen).

    DATE/TIME
    - Improved performance of the Calendar class (thanks to Leonardo Arcari).
    - Updated holidays for Indian and Russian calendars (thanks to Alexey
      Indiryakov).
    - Added missing All Souls Day holiday to Mexican calendar (thanks to
      GitHub user `phil-zxx` for the heads-up).
    - Restored New Year's Eve holiday to Eurex calendar (thanks to Joshua
      Engelman).

    DEPRECATED FEATURES
    - Features deprecate in version 1.15 were removed: constructors of
      inflation swap helpers, inflation-based pricing engines and
      inflation coupon pricers that didn't take a nominal term structure.
    - The constructor of `BMAIndex` taking a calendar was deprecated.
    - The constructors of several interest-rate term structures taking
      jumps without a reference date were deprecated.
    - The `CurveDependentStepCondition` class and related typedefs were
      deprecated.
    - The constructor of `BlackCalibrationHelper` taking an interest-rate
      structure was deprecated.
    - The constructors of several inflation curves taking a nominal curve
      were deprecated.  The nominal curve should now be passed to the used
      coupon pricers.

    <strong>Release 1.18 - March 23rd, 2020</strong>

    PORTABILITY
    - As announced in the past release, support of Visual C++ 2010 is
      dropped.  Also, we'll probably deprecate Visual C++ 2012 in the
      next release in order to drop it around the end of 2020.

    BUILD
    - Cmake now installs headers with the correct folder hierarchy
      (thanks to Cheng Li).
    - The `--enable-unity-build` flag passed to configure now also
      causes the test suite to be built as a single source file.
    - The Visual Studio projects now allow enabling unity builds as
      described at
      <https://devblogs.microsoft.com/cppblog/support-for-unity-jumbo-files-in-visual-studio-2017-15-8-experimental/>

    TERM STRUCTURES
    - A new `GlobalBootstrap` class can now be used with
      `PiecewiseYieldCurve` and other bootstrapped curves (thanks to
      Peter Caspers).  It allows to produce curves close to
      Bloomberg's.
    - The experimental `SofrFutureRateHelper` class and its parent
      `OvernightIndexFutureRateHelper` can now choose to use either
      compounding or averaging, in order to accommodate different
      conventions for 1M and 3M SOFR futures (thanks to GitHub user
      `tani3010`).
    - The `FraRateHelper` class has new constructors that take IMM
      start / end offsets (thanks to Peter Caspers).
    - It is now possible to pass explicit minimum and maximum values
      to the `IterativeBootstrap` class.  The accuracy parameter was
      also moved to the same class; passing it to the curve
      constructor is now deprecated.

    INSTRUMENTS
    - It is now possible to build fixed-rate bonds with an arbitrary
      schedule, even without a regular tenor (thanks to Steven Van
      Haren).

    MODELS
    - It is now possible to use normal volatilities to calibrate a
      short-rate model over caps.

    DATE/TIME
    - The Austrian calendar was added (thanks to Benjamin
      Schwendinger).
    - The German calendar incorrectly listed December 31st as a
      holiday; this is now fixed (thanks to Prasad Somwanshi).
    - Chinese holidays were updated for 2020 and the coronavirus event
      (thanks to Cheng Li).
    - South Korea holidays were updated for 2016-2020 (thanks to
      GitHub user `fayce66`).
    - In the calendar class, `holidayList` is now an instance method;
      the static version is deprecated.  The `businessDayList` method
      was also added.  (Thanks to Piotr Siejda.)
    - A bug in the 30/360 German day counter was fixed (thanks to Kobe
      Young for the heads-up).

    OPTIMIZERS
    - The differential evolution optimizer was updated (thanks to
      Peter Caspers).

    CURRENCIES
    - Added Kazakstani Tenge to currencies (thanks to Jonathan Barber).

    DEPRECATED FEATURES
    - Features deprecate in version 1.14 were removed: one of the
      constructors of the `BSMOperator` class, the whole
      `OperatorFactory` class, and the typedef `CalibrationHelper`
      which was used to alias the `BlackCalibrationHelper` class.
    - The `CalibrationHelperBase` class is now called
      `CalibrationHelper`. The old name remains as a typedef but is
      deprecated.
    - The overload of `CalibratedModel::calibrate` and
      `CalibratedModel::value` taking a vector of
      `BlackCalibrationHelper`s are deprecated in favor of the ones
      taking a vector of `CalibrationHelper`s.
    - The static method `Calendar::holidayList` is deprecated in favor
      of the instance method by the same name.
    - The constructors of `PiecewiseDefaultCurve` and
      `PiecewiseYieldCurve` taking an accuracy parameter are
      deprecated in favor of passing the parameter to an instance of
      the bootstrap class.
    - The constructors of `BondHelper` and derived classes taking a
      boolean flag to choose between clean and dirty price are
      deprecated in favor of the ones taking a `Bond::Price::Type`
      argument.  The `useCleanPrice` method is also deprecated in
      favor of `priceType`.

    <strong>Release 1.17 - December 3rd, 2019</strong>

    PORTABILITY
    - As of this release, support of Visual C++ 2010 is deprecated; it
      will be dropped in next release.  Also, we'll probably deprecate
      Visual C++ 2012 in one of the next few releases in order to drop
      it around the end of 2020.

    CONFIGURATION
    - A new function `compiledBoostVersion()` is available, (thanks to
      Andrew Smith).  It returns the version of Boost used to compile
      the library, as reported by the `BOOST_VERSION` macro.  This can
      help avoid linking the library with user code compiled with a
      different Boost version (which can result in erratic behavior).
    - It is now possible to specify at run time whether to use indexed
      coupons (thanks to Ralf Konrad).  The compile-time configuration
      is still used as a default, but it is also possible to call
      either of the static methods `IborCoupon::createAtParCoupons` or
      `IborCoupon::createIndexedCoupons` to specify your preference.
      For the time being, the methods above must necessarily be called
      before creating any instance of `IborCoupon` or of its derived
      classes.

    BUILD
    - As of this version, the names of the binaries produced by the
      included Visual C++ solution no longer contain the toolset
      version (e.g., v142).

    INSTRUMENTS
    - Added ex-coupon functionality to floating-rate bonds (thanks to
      Steven Van Haren).
    - The inner structure `Callability::Price` was moved to the class
      `Bond` and can now be used to specify what kind of price was
      passed to the `BondFunctions::yield` method (thanks to Francois
      Botha).
    - It is now possible to use a par-coupon approximation for FRAs
      like the one used in Ibor coupons (thanks to Peter Caspers).

    PRICING ENGINES
    - Added escrowed dividend model to the new-style FD engine for
      `DividendVanillaOption` (thanks to Klaus Spanderen).
    - Black cap/floor engine now also returns caplet deltas (thanks to
      Wojciech Slusarski).

    TERM STRUCTURES
    - OIS rate helpers can now choose whether to use as a pillar for
      the bootstrap either their maturity date or the end date of the
      last underlying fixing.  This provides an alternative if the
      bootstrap should fail.  (Thanks to Drew Saunders for the
      heads-up.)
    - Instances of the `FittedBondDiscountCurve` class now behave as
      simple evaluators (that is, they use the given parameters without
      performing root-solving) when the `maxIterations` parameter is
      set to 0.  (Thanks to Nick Firoozye for the heads-up.)

    DATE/TIME
    - Added a few special closing days to the US government bond
      calendar (thanks to Mike DelMedico).
    - Fixed an incorrect 2019 holiday in Chinese calendar (thanks to
      Cheng Li).
    - Added missing holiday to Swedish calendar (thanks to GitHub
      users `periculus` and `tonyzhipengzhou`).

    DEPRECATED FEATURES
    - The classes `FDEuropeanEngine`, `FDAmericanEngine`,
      `FDBermudanEngine`, `FDDividendEuropeanEngine`,
      `FDDividendEuropeanEngineShiftScale`,
      `FDDividendAmericanEngine`, `FDDividendAmericanEngineShiftScale`
      are now deprecated.  They are superseded by
      `FdBlackScholesVanillaEngine`.

    <strong>Release 1.16 - August 5th, 2019</strong>

    PORTABILITY
    - Added support for Visual Studio 2019 (thanks to Paul Giltinan).

    CONFIGURATION
    - As announced in past release, the compile-time switch to force
      non-negative rates was removed.

    PRICING ENGINES
    - Added constant elasticity of variance (CEV) pricing engines for
      vanilla options.  Analytic, FD and SABR engines are available
      (thanks to Klaus Spanderen).
    - Added quanto pricing functionality to a couple of FD engines for
      DividendVanillaOption (thanks to Klaus Spanderen).

    CASH FLOWS
    - Digital coupons can now optionally return the value of the naked
      option (thanks to Peter Caspers).

    DATE/TIME
    - Updated Taiwan holidays for 2019 (thanks to Hank Liu).
    - Added two newly announced holidays to Chinese calendar (thanks to
      Cheng Li).
    - Updated Japan calendar (thanks to Eisuke Tani).
    - Fixed New Year's day adjustment for Canadian calendar (thanks to Roy
      Zywina).
    - Added a couple of exceptions for UK bank holidays (thanks to GitHub
      user Vililikku for the heads-up).

    - Added public methods to expose a calendar's added and removed
      holidays (thanks to Francois Botha).
    - Allow the stub date of a schedule to equal the maturity.

    DEPRECATED FEATURES

      didn't take a calendar.
    - Removed typedefs GammaDistribution, ChiSquareDistribution,
      NonCentralChiSquareDistribution and
      InverseNonCentralChiSquareDistribution, deprecated in version 1.12.
      Use CumulativeGammaDistribution, CumulativeChiSquareDistribution,
      NonCentralCumulativeChiSquareDistribution and
      InverseNonCentralCumulativeChiSquareDistribution instead.
    - Removed Actual365NoLeap class, deprecated in version 1.11.  It was
      folded into Actual365Fixed.

    TERM STRUCTURES
    - Take payment days into account when calculating the nodes of a
      bootstrapped curve based on overnight swaps.

    <strong>Release 1.15 - February 19th, 2019</strong>

    PORTABILITY
    - This release drops support for Boost version 1.43 to 1.47; the
      minimum required version is now Boost 1.48, released in 2011.
    - Added a `.clang-format` file to the repository.  The format is
      not going to be enforced, but the style file is provided as a
      convenience in case you want to format new code according to the
      conventions of the library.
    - `boost::function`, `boost::bind` and a few related classes and
      functions were imported into the new namespace `QuantLib::ext`.
      This allows them to be conditionally replaced with their `std::`
      versions (see the "opt-in features" section below).  The default
      is still to use the Boost implementation.  Client code using the
      `boost` namespace explicitly doesn't need to be updated.

    MODELS
    - Added an experimental volatility basis model for caplet and
      swaptions (thanks to Sebastian Schlenkrich).

    PRICING ENGINES
    - It is now possible to specify polynomial order and type when
      creating a `MCAmericanBasketEngine` instance (thanks to Klaus
      Spanderen).

    TERM STRUCTURES
    - Inflation curves used to store the nominal curve used during
      their construction.  This is still supported for backward
      compatibility, but is deprecated.  You should instead pass the
      nominal curve explicitly to objects that need one (e.g.,
      inflation helpers, engines, or cashflow pricers).
    - Added experimental helpers to bootstrap an interest-rate curve
      on SOFR futures (thanks to Roy Zywina).

    INDEXES
    - It is now possible to choose the fixing calendar for the BMA
      index (thanks to Jan Ladislav Dussek).

    CASH FLOWS
    - Fixed broken observability in CMS-spread coupon pricer (thanks
      to Peter Caspers).

    DATE/TIME
    - Fix implementation of Actual/Actual (ISMA) day counter in case a
      schedule is provided (thanks to Philip Stephens).
    - Fix implementation of `Calendar::businessDaysBetween` method
      when the initial and final date are the same (thanks to Weston
      Steimel).
    - Added day of mourning for G.H.W. Bush to the list of United
      States holidays (thanks to Joshua Engelman).
    - Updated list of Chinese holidays for 2019 (thanks to Cheng Li).
    - Added basic unit tests for the `TimeGrid` class (thanks to Kai
      Striega).

    MATH
    - Prevent solver failure in Richardson extrapolation (thanks to
      Klaus Spanderen).

    EXAMPLES
    - Added multi-curve bootstrapping example (thanks to Jose
      Garcia). This examples supersedes the old swap-valuation
      example, that was therefore removed.

    NEW OPT-IN FEATURES
    - It is now possible to use `std::function`, `std::bind` and their
      related classes instead of `boost::function` and `boost::bind`.
      The feature can be enabled by uncommenting the
      `QL_USE_STD_FUNCTION` macro in `ql/userconfig.hpp` on Visual C++
      or by passing the `--enable-std-function` to `./configure` on
      other systems.  This requires using at least the C++11 standard
      during compilation.
    - A new `./configure` switch, `--enable-std-classes`, was added as
      a shortcut for `--enable-std-pointers` `--enable-std-unique-ptr`
      `--enable-std-function`.

    <strong>Release 1.14 - October 1st, 2018</strong>

    PORTABILITY
    - In April 2018, Microsoft ended its support for Microsoft Visual
      C++ 2008. As previously announced, this release drops support
      for it.
    - Fixed generation of RPM from QuantLib.spec (thanks to Simon Rees).
    - Avoided uses of some features removed in C++17 so that the
      library can be compiled under the latest standard if needed.
    - `boost::shared_ptr` and a few related classes and functions were
      imported into the new namespace `QuantLib::ext`.  This allows them
      to be conditionally replaced with their `std::` versions (see the
      "opt-in features" section below).  The default is still to use
      the boost implementation.  Client code using the `boost` namespace
      explicitly doesn't need to be updated.
    - Fixed build and tests on FreeBSD-11 (thanks to Klaus Spanderen
      and to Mikhail Teterin for the heads-up).
    - Fixed tests with the `-ffast-math` compilation flag enabled
      (thanks to Klaus Spanderen and to Jon Davies for the heads-up).

    INSTRUMENTS AND PRICING ENGINES
    - Add different settlement methods for swaptions (thanks to Peter
      Caspers).
    - Take into account distinct day-count conventions for different
      curves in the analytic barrier-option engine (thanks to GitHub
      user cosplay-raven).
    - Extract the correct constant coefficients to use in
      finite-difference vanilla-option engine when using a
      time-dependent Black-Scholes process (thanks to GitHub user
      Grant6899 for the analysis).

    CASH FLOWS AND INTEREST RATES
    - Added Bibor and THBFIX indices (thanks to Matthias Lungwitz).

    MODELS
    - Added a hook for using a custom smile model in the Markov functional
      model (thanks to Peter Caspers).
    - Added a base class CalibrationHelperBase to the hierarchy of
      calibration helpers in order to allow for helpers not using the
      Black model.
    - Return underlying dynamics from Black-Karasinski model (thanks
      to Fanis Antoniou).

    FINITE DIFFERENCES
    - Added higher-order spatial operators (thanks to Klaus Spanderen).
    - Added TR-BDF2 finite-difference scheme (thanks to Klaus Spanderen).

    TERM STRUCTURES
    - Allow swap helpers to specify end-of-month convention (thanks to
      Matthias Lungwitz).

    DATE/TIME
    - Prevented division by zero in Actual/365 Canadian day counter
      (thanks to Ioannis Rigopoulos for the heads-up).
    - Added Children's Day to the list of Romanian holidays (thanks to
      Matthias Lungwitz).
    - Added new calendar for Thailand (thanks to Matthias Lungwitz).
    - Added 30/360 German day counter (thanks to Peter Caspers and
      Alexey Indiryakov).

    MATH
    - Fixed bug in convex-monotone interpolation (thanks to Peter
      Caspers for the fix and to Tom Anderson for finding the bug).

    NEW OPT-IN FEATURES
    - It is now possible to use `std::shared_ptr` and its related
      classes instead of `boost::shared_ptr`.  Note that, unlike its
      boost counterpart, `std::shared_ptr` doesn't check for null
      pointers before access; this can lead to crashes.  The feature
      can be enabled by uncommenting the `QL_USE_STD_SHARED_PTR` macro
      in `ql/userconfig.hpp` on Visual C++ or by passing the
      `--enable-std-pointers` to `./configure` on other systems.  This
      requires using at least the C++11 standard during compilation.
    - It is now possible to use `std::unique_ptr` instead of
      `std::auto_ptr`; this makes it possible to compile the library in
      strict C++17 mode and to avoid deprecation warnings in C++11 and
      C++14 mode.  The feature can be enabled by uncommenting the
      `QL_USE_STD_UNIQUE_PTR` macro in `ql/userconfig.hpp` on Visual C++
      or by passing the `--enable-std-unique-ptr` to `./configure` on
      other systems.

    Thanks go also to Sam Danbury, Barry Devlin, Roland Kapl, and GitHub
    user todatamining for smaller fixes, enhancements, and bug reports.

    <strong>Release 1.13 - May 24th, 2018</strong>

    PORTABILITY
    - In April 2018, Microsoft ended its support for Microsoft Visual
      C++ 2008. This release still includes a solution file for VC++
      2008, but we won't support it further or take bug reports for
      it. The next release will only contain project files for Visual
      C++ 2010 and later.
    - Fixed build on Solaris 12.5 in C++11 mode (thanks to Nick Glass).

    INSTRUMENTS AND PRICING ENGINES
    - Fix CDS calculation when the start date falls during the
      week-end (thanks to Guillaume Horel).
    - Allow construction of a `ForwardRateAgreement` instance even if
      the interest-rate curve is not yet linked (thanks to Tom
      Anderson).

    CASH FLOWS AND INTEREST RATES

      and to Seung Beom Bang for the heads up).
    - Fixed an out-of-bound access in the
      TwoFactorModel::ShortRateDynamics::process method (thanks to
      Weston Steimel).

    FINITE DIFFERENCES
    - Improved Black-Scholes mesher for low volatilities and high
      discrete dividends (thanks to Klaus Spanderen).
    - Added method-of-lines scheme (thanks to Klaus Spanderen).

    DATE/TIME
    - Schedule::until can now be used with schedules built from
      vectors of dates (thanks to GitHub user Grant6899).
    - Added Good Friday to the list of Hungarian and Czech holidays
      (thanks to Matthias Lungwitz).
    - Updated the list of Turkish holidays after 2014 (thanks to
      Matthias Lungwitz).

    MATH
    - Added convenience operators to initialize array and matrices
      (thanks to Peter Caspers).

    TEST SUITE
    - Added test case for CIR++ model (thanks to Klaus Spanderen).

      QuantLib to support it with maintained project files.
    - It is now possible to build a usable library with CMake on
      Windows (thanks to Javier G. Sogo).
    - Fix autotools build outside the source tree (thanks to Joshua
      Ulrich).

    INSTRUMENTS AND PRICING ENGINES
    - Added OAS calculation to experimental callable bonds (thanks to
      Bojan Nikolic).
    - Avoided infinite loop for some sets of parameters in
      experimental variance-gamma engine (thanks to Roy Zywina).

    CASH FLOWS

    PORTABILITY
    - This is the last version of QuantLib to support the now obsolete
      Dev-C++ IDE with a maintained project file.  The project will be
      removed in next release.

    INSTRUMENTS AND PRICING ENGINES
    - Added ISDA pricing engine for credit default swaps (thanks to
      Guillaume Horel, Jose Aparicio and Peter Caspers).
    - Added Andersen-Piterbarg engine for the Heston model (thanks to

      (deprecated in version 1.9).
    - Remove the MixedLinearCubicInterpolation and MixedLinearCubic
      constructors not specifying the behavior of the mixed
      interpolation (deprecated in version 1.8).
    - Remove deprecated overloads of the Swaption::impliedVolatility
      and CapFloor::impliedVolatility methods (deprecated in version
      1.9).
    - Remove NoArbSabrModel::checkAbsorptionMatrix method (deprecated
      in version 1.8.1).

    <strong>Release 1.10.1 - August 31st, 2017</strong>

    %QuantLib 1.10.1 is a bug-fix release for version 1.10.

    - Prevented a name clash when using the newly-released Boost 1.65.0
      with g++ 6.3.

    <strong>Release 1.10 - May 16th, 2017</strong>

    PORTABILITY
    - Added support for the recently released Visual Studio 2017.
    - Unified Visual Studio solution file.  The provided QuantLib.sln
      file works for all versions from 2010 to 2017.
    - Added support for the recently released Boost 1.64.0 (thanks to
      Klaus Spanderen).
    - Converted non-ASCII characters in source files to UTF-8; this
      should make them work with most editors (thanks to Krzysztof Woś
      and Jose Aparicio).
    - Fixed some compilation issues with older versions of the Sun CC
      compiler and with the gcc 3.4 series.  The offending code has
      simply been disabled; when using those compilers, is also
      suggested to downgrade Boost to an older version since more
      recent ones can give problems.  Boost 1.54.0 was reported to
      work.  It is likely that no further support will be given to
      these compilers in future releases.

    INSTRUMENTS AND PRICING ENGINES
    - Added Heston pricing engine based on Fourier-Cosine series
      expansion (thanks to Klaus Spanderen).
    - Added cash annuity model in Black swaption engine (thanks to
      Peter Caspers, Werner Kuerzinger and Paul Giltinan).

      Spanderen).
    - Optionally disable Feller constraint in Cox-Ingersoll-Ross model
      (thanks to Oleksandr Khomenko).

    INTEREST RATES
    - Allow using an arbitrary solver to calculate yield (thanks to
      Daniel Hrabovcak).
    - Update handling of July 4th for US LIBOR fixings (thanks to Oleg
      Kulkov).
    - Added CompoundingThenSimple convention (thanks to Martin Ross).

    INFLATION
    - Use the lagged reference period to interpolate inflation fixings
      (thanks to Francois Botha).

    VOLATILITY
    - Reduce the memory footprint of OptionletStripper1 (thanks to
      Matthias Lungwitz)

    DATE/TIME
    - Updated Chinese calendar for 2017 (thanks to Cheng Li).
    - Added CDS2015 date-generation rule with the correct semiannual
      frequency (thanks to Guillaume Horel).
    - The Iceland calendar used to incorrectly adjust New Year's Day
      to the next Monday when falling on a holiday. That's now fixed
      (thanks to Stefan Gunnsteinsson for the heads-up).
    - Fixed bug that prevented correct calculation of an ECB date on
      the first day of a month (thanks to Nicholas Bertocchi).
    - Fixed bug in Schedule that ignored end-of-month convention when
      calculating reference dates for irregular coupons (thanks to
      Ryan Taylor).
    - Allow passing a schedule to Actual/Actual day counter for
      correct calculation of reference dates (thanks to Ryan Taylor).

    MATH
    - Added harmonic spline interpolation (thanks to Nicholas Bertocchi).

    EXAMPLES
    - Added examples for global optimizers (thanks to Andres Hernandez).

    DEPRECATED FEATURES
    - Removed the SwaptionHelper constructors not taking an explicit
      volatility type (deprecated in version 1.8).
    - Removed the SwaptionVolatilityMatrix constructors not taking an
      explicit volatility type (deprecated in version 1.8).
    - Removed the BlackSwaptionEngine constructor overriding the
      displacement from the given volatility structure (deprecated in
      version 1.8).
    - Removed the FlatSmileSection and InterpolatedSmileSection
      constructors not taking an explicit volatility type (deprecated
      in version 1.8).
    - Removed the RiskyAssetSwapOption constructor taking a side
      (deprecated in version 1.8).

    POSSIBLY BREAKING CHANGES
    - The constructors of a few Libor-like indexes were made
      explicit. This means that code such as the following, which used
      to compile, will now break.  That's probably a good thing.
      \code
      Handle<YieldTermStructure> forecast_curve;
      Euribor6M index = forecast_curve;
      \endcode

    <strong>Release 1.9.2 - February 27th, 2017</strong>

    %QuantLib 1.9.2 is a bug-fix release for version 1.9.1.

    - Prevented errors in yield-curve bootstrapping tests due to an
      incorrect test setup (thanks to Peter Caspers for the heads-up).

    <strong>Release 1.9.1 - January 5th, 2017</strong>

    %QuantLib 1.9.1 is a bug-fix release for version 1.9.

    - Prevented a linking error when multiple compilation units
      included the global ql/quantlib.hpp header (thanks to Dirk
      Eddelbuettel).
    - Prevented a compilation error with gcc 4.4 on RedHat (thanks to
      GitHub user aloupos for the heads-up).
    - Prevented a compilation error with the parallel unit runner and
      the recently released Boost 1.63.0.

    <strong>Release 1.9 - November 8th, 2016</strong>

    PORTABILITY
    - Dropped support for Visual C++ 8 (2005).  As of April 2016, the
      compiler is no longer supported by Microsoft.
    - Allow the parallel test runner to work with Boost 1.62 (thanks
      to Klaus Spanderen for the fix and to Andrei Borodaenko for the
      heads-up).

    INTEREST RATES
    - Allow negative jumps in interest-rate curves. Previously, trying
      to pass one would result in an exception (thanks to Leanpub
      reader Jeff for the heads-up).

    NEW OPT-IN FEATURES

    These features are disabled by default and can be enabled by
    defining a macro or passing a flag to `./configure`.  Feedback is
    appreciated.
    - Enable thread-safe singleton initialization (thanks to GitHub
      user sdgit). The feature can be enabled by uncommenting the
      `QL_ENABLE_SINGLETON_THREAD_SAFE_INIT` macro in
      `ql/userconfig.hpp` on Visual C++ or by passing the
      `--enable-thread-safe-singleton-init` to `./configure` on other
      systems.

    EXPERIMENTAL FOLDER

    The `ql/experimental` folder contains code whose interface is not
    fully stable, but is released in order to get user feedback.
    Experimental classes make no guarantees of backward compatibility;
    their interfaces might change in future releases.

    Changes and new contributions for this release were:
    - OIS with arithmetic average (thanks to Stefano Fondi). A
      corresponding bootstrap helpers is also available.
    - a function to calculate multi-curve sensitivities (thanks to
      Michael von den Driesch).

    <strong>Release 1.8.1 - September 23rd, 2016</strong>

    %QuantLib 1.8.1 is a bug-fix release for version 1.8.

    - A test failure with Visual C++ 14 (2015) was avoided. Up to
      VC++14 update 2, the compiler would inline a call to std::min
      and std::max incorrectly causing a calculation to fail (thanks
      to Ivan Cherkasov for the heads-up).
    - A test failure with the upcoming Boost 1.62 was avoided.  A
      QuantLib test was checking for the stored value of a hash whose
      value changed in Boost 1.62.
    - Miscellaneous fixes for the g1d swaption engine and instrument
      (thanks to Peter Caspers).
    - Whit Monday was no longer a holiday in Sweden since 2005 (thanks
      to Stefano Fondi).
    - A new holiday for election day 2016 was added to the South
      African calendar (thanks to Jasen Mackie).
    - A few missing CMakeLists were added to the distributed release
      (thanks to izavyalov for the heads-up).
    - An irregular last period in a schedule was not reported as such
      (thanks to Schmidt for the heads-up).

    <strong>Release 1.8 - May 18th, 2016</strong>

    PORTABILITY
    - The minimum required Boost version is now Boost 1.43 (May
      2010). However, it is strongly suggested to use a recent
      version, or at least Boost 1.48 (November 2011).
    - Added initial CMake support (thanks to Dmitri Nesteruk). This
      makes it possible to compile %QuantLib on CLion and other
      CMake-based tools.
    - The build now generates and installs pkg-config file on Linux
      systems (thanks to GitHub user njwhite).

    INTEREST RATES
    - Fixed links to documentation for LIBOR indexes (thanks to Jose
      Magana).

    VOLATILITY
    - Added the possibility to price swaptions and to calculate their
      implied volatilities in a Black-like model with normal
      volatilities as well as shifted lognormal (thanks to Peter
      Caspers).
    - Added the possibility to price caps in a Black-like model with
      normal volatilities as well as shifted lognormal (thanks to
      Michael von den Driesch).
    - Caplet strike is correctly recomputed during stripping (thanks
      to Michael von den Driesch).

    INSTRUMENTS
    - Added basic CVA IRS pricing engine (stand alone, no portfolio;
      no WWR, no collateral). Thanks to Jose Aparicio.

    MODELS
    - Black-Scholes processes now return the closed-formula
      expectation, standard deviation and variance over long periods
      (thanks to Peter Caspers).

      maksym-studenets).

    MONTE CARLO
    - Use different random-number generators for calibration and
      pricing in Longstaff-Schwartz engine (thanks to Peter Caspers).

    DATE/TIME
    - Added forecast dates for moving holidays to Saudi Arabia
      calendar up to 2022 (thanks to Jayanth R. Varma).
    - Added new Ukrainian holiday, Defender's Day (thanks to GitHub
      user maksym-studenets).
    - Added a few more holidays for South Korea (thanks to Faycal El
      Karaa).

    MATH
    - Added mixed log interpolation (thanks to GitHub user sfondi).
    - Avoid mixing different types while bit-shifting in fast Fourier
      transform on 64-bit systems (thanks to Nikolai Nowaczyk).

    DEPRECATED FEATURES
    - Removed `DateParser::split` method (deprecated in version 1.6).

    TEST SUITE
    - The test suite is now run with a fixed evaluation date instead
      of using today's date. This helps avoid transient errors due to
      holidays. It is still possible to use today's date (or any other
      date) by running it as:
      \code
      quantlib-test-suite -- --date=today
      \endcode
      or
      \code
      quantlib-test-suite -- --date=2016-02-08
      \endcode
      (Thanks to Peter Caspers.)

    NEW OPT-IN FEATURES
    - Added a parallel unit-test runner (thanks to Klaus
      Spanderen). This was successfully used under Linux, but problems
      were reported on Mac OS X and occasionally on Visual C++ 2010.
      The feature requires Boost 1.59 or later and can be enabled by
      uncommenting the `QL_ENABLE_PARALLEL_UNIT_TEST_RUNNER` macro in
      `ql/userconfig.hpp` on Visual C++ or by passing the
      `--enable-parallel-unit-test-runner` to `./configure` on other
      systems.

    EXPERIMENTAL FOLDER
    - Stochastic local-volatility Heston model, (thanks to Klaus
      Spanderen and Johannes Göttker-Schnetmann). Both a Monte Carlo
      and a finite-difference calibration and calculation are
      provided.

      (thanks to Peter Caspers).

    <strong>Release 1.7.1 - January 18th, 2016</strong>

    %QuantLib 1.7.1 is a bug-fix release for version 1.7.

    - an unneeded dependency on the Boost.Thread library had slipped into
      version 1.7. It is now removed (thanks to GitHub user MattPD).
    - Trying to build a schedule with a 4-weeks tenor would fail. This is
      now fixed (thanks to GitHub user smallnamespace for the heads-up).

    - The correct curve is now used when calculating the at-the-money swap
      rate while building swaptions (thanks to Peter Caspers).

    <strong>Release 1.7 - November 23rd, 2015</strong>

    INTEREST RATES
    - Added rate helper to bootstrap on cross-currency swaps (thanks
      to Maddalena Zanzi). The curve to be bootstrapped can be the one
      for either of the two currencies.
    - Added the possibility for bootstrap helpers to define their
      pillar date in different ways (thanks to Paolo Mazzocchi).  For
      each helper, the date of the corresponding node can be defined
      as the maturity date of the corresponding instrument, as the
      latest date used on the term structure to price the instrument,
      or as a custom date. Currently, the feature is enabled for FRAs
      and swaps.
    - Added the possibility to pass weight when fitting a bond
      discount curve. Also, it is now possible to fit a spread over an
      existing term structure (thanks to Andres Hernandez).

    INFLATION
    - Added Kerkhof seasonality model (thanks to Bernd Lewerenz).
    - Retrieve inflation fixings from the first day of the month
      (thanks to Gerardo Ballabio). This avoids the need to store them
      for each day of the corresponding month.

    MONTE CARLO
    - Added the possibility to return the estimated exercise
      probability from a Longstaff-Schwartz engine (thanks to Giorgio
      Pazmandi).

      with Boost implementation (thanks to Peter Caspers).
    - Added Goldstein line-search method (thanks to Cheng Li).

    NEW OPT-IN FEATURES
    - Added intraday component to dates (thanks to Klaus Spanderen).
      Date specifications now include hours, minutes, seconds,
      milliseconds and microseconds.  Day counters are aware of the
      added data and include them in results.
      The feature can be enabled by uncommenting the
      `QL_HIGH_RESOLUTION_DATE` macro in `ql/userconfig.hpp` on Visual
      C++ or by passing the `--enable-intraday` flag to `./configure`
      on other systems.
    - Added thread-safe implementation of the Observer pattern (thanks
      to Klaus Spanderen). This can be used to avoid crashes when
      using %QuantLib from languages (such as C# or Java) that run a
      garbage collector in a separate thread.
      The feature requires Boost 1.58 or later and can be enabled by
      uncommenting the `QL_ENABLE_THREAD_SAFE_OBSERVER_PATTERN` macro
      in `ql/userconfig.hpp` on Visual C++ or by passing the
      `--enable-thread-safe-observer-pattern` to `./configure` on
      other systems.

    <strong>Release 1.6.2 - September 2015</strong>

    %QuantLib 1.6.2 is a compatibility release. It solves an ambiguous
    name resolution in the test-suite code when Visual Studio and the
    newly released Boost 1.59.0 are used together.

    The library code did not change.

    <strong>Release 1.6.1 - August 3rd, 2015</strong>

    <strong>Release 1.4.1 - November 17th, 2014</strong>

    %QuantLib 1.4.1 is a compatibility release. It fixes a number of
    compilation errors that surfaced when using %QuantLib 1.4 with
    Clang 3.5 and Boost 1.57. Thanks to Tim Smith for the heads-up.

    If you are not using Clang, you don't need to upgrade from
    %QuantLib 1.4 to 1.4.1.

    <strong>Release 1.4 - February 26th, 2014</strong>

    PORTABILITY
    - Boost 1.39 or later is now required.
      We felt this could be enforced without causing grief to
      virtually anyone, given that 1.39 was released back in May 2009.
      We don't expect many people being stuck with an earlier version.
      This allows one to use make_shared to create shared_ptr
      instances, which has a number of advantages.  Unfortunately, the
      C++03 implementation (which is still used by a number of older
      compiler that we're supporting) only allows a maximum of 9
      constructor arguments, so we won't be able to use it everywhere.
    - Support for Visual C++ 2003 (VC++7) was dropped.
      The compiler is now more than 10 years old and no longer
      supported by Microsoft.  Keeping the support is not worth the
      time and effort required.  Anybody who is still stuck with this
      compiler and needs the support can fork the repository and
      maintain the changes.
    - Specific support for Visual C++ 2013 (VC++12) is not yet
      available; however, version checks in the code were relaxed so
      that one can import and convert the VC++11 solution without
      causing errors when auto-linking the generated libraries.
    - Fixed Clang warnings.
    - Use deprecated attribute of supported compilers.
      This replaces the QL_DISABLE_DEPRECATED mechanism that
      conditionally removes the features and causes the compiler
      itself to emit warnings if the features are used.  The user
      can enable or disable the warnings by the means provided by
      the compiler.
    - Allow singletons to work under Visual C++ when CLR is enabled
      (thanks to Simon Shakeshaft).
    - Fixed compilation errors when using STLport (thanks to Marcello
      Pietrobon for the heads-up).

    CONFIGURATION
    - Added switch to enable OpenMP-based parallelism (thanks to
      Joseph Wang).  Currently, this is only used in a few loops in
      the finite-differences and tree frameworks.

    DATE/TIME
    - Added Diamond Jubilee bank holiday to UK calendar.
    - Added Royal Wedding bank holiday to UK calendar (thanks to
      Whit Armstrong for the heads-up).
    - Added utilities to parse and format a date with the extended
      format implemented in Boost.Date (thanks to Michael von den
      Driesch).  The previous parsing utility was deprecated.
    - Added Actual/365 (No Leap) day counter (thanks to Nick Glass).
    - Updated most moving holidays for 2014.
    - Fixed a Schedule bug where a combination of backwards generation
      and end-of-month convention would result in missing or
      duplicated dates (thanks to Nicholas Manganaro for the heads-up).

    INSTRUMENTS
    - Fixed Delta and Gamma calculation in Ju quadratic engine (thanks
      to Fabien Le Floc'h).
    - Improved calculation in finite-differences Asian options when
      the running average is much greater than the forward value
      (thanks to Klaus Spanderen).
    - Fixed Theta issue for some American FDM engines (thanks to Klaus
      Spanderen).
    - Fix annuity computation for CMS coupons (thanks to Peter Caspers).
    - Enabled case r=0 in Barone-Adesi/Whaley approximation engine
      (thanks to Klaus Spanderen).
    - When building a swaption with MakeSwaption, use the fixed tenor
      of the underlying swap index if none is given explicitly.

    MODELS
    - Allow for calibration of just a subset of a model's parameters.
      Pre-built constraint are provided for calibration of an
      Hull-White model while fixing the mean reversion, and for
      calibration of a Markov functional model while fixing the first
      component of the piecewise volatility. (Thanks to Peter Caspers.)
    - Allow recalculation of exercise and end dates in swaption and
      cap helpers when the evaluation date changes (thanks to Peter
      Caspers).
    - Allowed negative strikes in BlackFormula, as long as the strike
      plus the displacement is still positive (thanks to Peter
      Caspers).
    - Added calculation of implied volatility from Bachelier price in
      BlackFormula (thanks to Gary Kennedy).
    - Added Broadie-Kaya exact simulation schema to Heston model
      (thanks to Klaus Spanderen).

      specified for fixed rate bonds.
    - Fixed calculation of duration and convexity when using
      Act/Act(ISMA) (thanks to Nick Glass).

    INDEXES
    - Fixed IborCoupon construction with null fixing days.
      The coupon was used the passed fixing days instead of the ones
      previously processed by the base class constructor (thanks to
      Lisa Ann and Gerardo Ballabio for the heads-up).
    - Add a clone() method to SwapIndex which allows to change the
      tenor (thanks to Peter Caspers).
    - Ignore inflation-index fixings stored at dates later than the
      evaluation date.
    - Added utility class for creating custom Region instances to be
      passed to inflation indexes.

    TERM STRUCTURES
    - Prevent some errors when linking a null term structure to a Handle.
      When settings a null term structure to a Handle used as an
      underlying for another curve (say, a zero-spreaded curve), the
      latter tries to reset the jumps in the base class and fails.
      This error is now trapped. (Thanks to Christoph Breig for
      the heads-up.)
    - Fix interpolation of option dates in SwaptionVolatilityDiscrete
      and derived classes when evaluation date changes (thanks to Shen
      Hui).
    - Piecewise-spreaded curve can now choose interpolation (thanks to

      model, and float/float swap and swaption with a number of
      corresponding engines. (Thanks to Peter Caspers.)
    - The Levy engine for continuous-averaging Asian option now checks
      that the averaging period doesn't start in the future. Also, it
      allows the b=0 case that would raise an exception until now.
      (Thanks to Klaus Spanderen.)
    - Convertible bond now updates correctly when any of its
      observables changes.
    - Extended generalized Hull-White model (thanks to Cavit Hafizoglu).
      The model now allows to choose the mapping function between short
      rate and state variable, and includes the case of constant
      parameters.

    <strong>Release 1.3 - July 24th, 2013</strong>

    PORTABILITY
    - Enabled g++ compilation in C++11 mode.

      G&ouml;ttker-Schnetmann).
    - Removed most level-4 warnings in VC++ (thanks to Michael Sharpe).
    - Removed warnings in VC++ when compiling for the x64 platform (thanks
      to Johannes G&ouml;ttker-Schnetmann).

    DATE/TIME

    INSTRUMENTS
    - Finite-difference Bermudan swaption engines for the G2++ and the
      Hull-White models (thanks to Klaus Spanderen).
    - Added analytic Heston-Hull-White pricing engine for vanilla option
      using the H1HW approximation (thanks to Klaus Spanderen).

      (thanks to Peter Caspers).
    - Yield-based NPV calculation now uses coupon reference dates; this
      fixes small discrepancies when using day counters such as ISMA
      act/act (thanks to Henri Gough and Nick Glass).
    - Fixed start and end dates for convexity adjustment of in-arrears
      floating-rate coupon (thanks to Peter Caspers).

      (thanks to Peter Caspers).

    TERM STRUCTURES

    - Relaxed extrapolation check for default-probability curves.  When
      calculating default probabilities between two dates or times, allow
      the first to precede the reference date. This effectively assumes
      that the default probability before the reference is null, and helps
      in cases where a coupon protection extends a couple of days before
      the reference due to adjustments (for instance, when the protection
      starts on a Saturday and the reference is rolled to the following
      Monday).
    - Pass correct ATM forward rate to smile section of SwaptionVolCube2
      (thanks to Peter Caspers).

      previously, they would always return false which could be surprising
      (thanks to Simon Shakeshaft for the fix).
    - Fixed Gamma distribution tail (thanks to Ian Qsong).
    - Ensure that the last function call inside a solver is passed the
      root (thanks to Francis Duffy).

    EXPERIMENTAL FOLDER

    The ql/experimental folder contains code which is still not fully
    integrated with the library or even fully tested, but is released in
    order to get user feedback.  Experimental classes are considered
    unstable; their interfaces might change in future releases.

    New contributions for this release were:
    - Two-asset barrier option and related engine (thanks to
      IMAFA/Polytech'Nice students Qingxiao Wang and Nabila Barkati).
    - ODE solver (thanks to Peter Caspers).
    - Markov functional model (thanks to Peter Caspers).

    <strong>Release 1.2.1 - September 10th, 2012</strong>

    Bug-fix release.

    <strong>Release 1.2 - March 6th, 2012</strong>

    PORTABILITY
    - Microsoft Visual C++ 2010 no longer needs to disable uBlas code.
    - %QuantLib now ships with an updated specification file for
      building RPMs (thanks to Matt Fair).

    DATE/TIME
    - When EOM was specified, a schedule's end date was moved to the
      end of month even if the 'Unadjusted' convention was given.
      This is now fixed.
    - When a daily frequency was used, a schedule could end up
      containing duplicated dates.  This is now fixed (thanks to
      Simone Medori for the bug report).
    - Added method to return truncated schedule.
    - Fixed Swedish Midsummer Eve's date (thanks to Gary Kennedy).
    - Added South Korea holidays for 2011/2012 (thanks to Charles
      Chongseok Hyun and Faycal El Karaa).
    - Added holidays for 2011 to China, Hong Kong, India, Indonesia,
      Saudi Arabia, and Taiwan calendars.
    - Added ECB maintenance dates for 2012 and 2013.
    - Greatly improved performance of business/252 day counter.  The
      previous implementation would count the business days between
      two dates at each invocation. The new implementation caches
      dynamically the count of business days for whole months and
      years, so that after a while only the first and last few days
      are counted.

    INSTRUMENTS
    - The AssetSwap instrument now supports non-par repayment.
    - Added specialized class for Italian CCTEU (certificato di
      credito del tesoro).
    - Added CPI-linked swaps, bonds, and cap/floors.

    CASH FLOWS
    - Added CashFlows::npvbps() method to calculate NPV and BPS in a
      single loop to improve performance.

    INDEXES
    - Better detection of forecast/past fixings for inflation indexes.
      When an interpolated index is asked for a fixing at the
      beginning of a month, the fixing for the following (which would
      have zero weight in the interpolation) is no longer required.
      Also, if a fixing is loaded in the index time series, it can be
      used even its observation lag has not fully elapsed.

    TERM STRUCTURES
    - Vastly improved the performance of piecewise yield curve
      bootstrap.  Anchoring the evaluation date (see below) provides a
      further improvement.
    - Moved CPI-volatility interface from experimental folder to the
      core library.

    MATH
    - Added Newton 1-D solver with finite difference derivatives.
    - Improved interface for linear least-square regression (thanks to
      Slava Mazur).

    FINITE DIFFERENCES
    - Added TR-BDF2 scheme (thanks to Fabien Le Floc'h).
    - Moved stable parts of 2D finite-difference framework from the
      experimental folder to the core library.

    UTILITIES
    - Added resetEvaluationDate() and anchorEvaluationDate() methods
      to enable/disable change of evaluation date at midnight,
      respectively.  Anchoring the evaluation date also improves the
      performance of some calculations.

    PATTERNS
    - Fixed possible problem in LazyObject notification logic.  The
      previous implementation would pass obsolete information to
      observers that asked for data in their update() method (which is
      not advised, but possible).  This is no longer the case.

    EXPERIMENTAL FOLDER

    The ql/experimental folder contains code which is still not fully
    integrated with the library or even fully tested, but is released

      Abdijalilov.)

      Hachemi Benyahia.)
    - More performant implementation of inverse cumulative distribution
      (thanks to Kakhkhor Abdijalilov.)
    - More performant mt19937 implementation (thanks to Kakhkhor
      Abdijalilov.)
    - Added more copulas (thanks to Hachemi Benyahia.)  The new formulas

    UTILITIES
    - Reworked Null class template (thanks to Kakhkhor Abdijalilov.)  The
      new implementation avoids the need for a macro on 64-bit systems and
      automatically covers all floating-point and integer types.

    EXPERIMENTAL FOLDER

    The ql/experimental folder contains code which is still not fully
    integrated with the library or even fully tested, but is released in
    order to get user feedback.  Experimental classes are considered
    unstable; their interfaces might change in future releases.

    New contributions for this release were:

    - Enabled language extensions in Visual Studio projects.
    - Prevented make errors with older shells (thanks to Walter Eaves.)

    DATE/TIME

      roll on the unadjusted end of month (possibly a holiday.)
    - Added new date-generation rule for CDS (thanks to Jose Aparicio.)
    - Fix for CDS fair-upfront calculation (thanks to Jose Aparicio.)

      interface.

    EXAMPLES
    - Added market-model example.

    EXPERIMENTAL FOLDER

    The ql/experimental folder contains code which is still not fully
    integrated with the library or even fully tested, but is released in

    - Multi-path generator now takes a generic stochastic process;
      tests provided.
    - New Path class implemented which stores asset values rather than
      variations; this makes pricers independent on whether or not
      log-variations were calculated. The new class is enabled when
      QL_DISABLE_DEPRECATED is defined; the old class is used
      otherwise.

    INSTRUMENTS

    - Formatters deprecated in favor of output manipulators. A number
      of data types can now be sent directly to output streams.
    - Stream-based implementation of QL_REQUIRE, QL_TRACE and similar
      macros. Together with manipulators, this allows one to write
      simpler error messages, as in:
      \code
      QL_FAIL("forward at date " << d << " is " << io::rate(f));
      \endcode

    INSTRUMENTS
    - Improved Bond class
      - yield-related calculation can be performed with either
        compounded or continuous compounding;
      - added theoretical price based on discount curve;
      - fixed-rate coupon bonds can define different rates for each
        coupon;
      - added zero-coupon and floating-rate bonds (thanks to StatPro.)
    - Option instruments now take a generic StochasticProcess;
      however, most pricing engines still require a
      BlackScholesProcess. They should be checked to see whether the
      requirement can be relaxed.  Following this change,
      Merton76Process no longer inherits from
      BlackScholesProcess. This avoids erroneous upcasts.
    - Partial fix for Bermudan swaptions with exercise lag (thanks to
      Luca Berardi for the report and discussion.)

    YIELD TERM STRUCTURES
    - Added generic piecewise yield term structure. Client code can
      choose what to interpolate (discounts, zero yields, forwards)
      and how (linear, log-linear, flat) by instantiating types such
      as:
      \code
      PiecewiseYieldCurve<Discount,LogLinear>
      PiecewiseYieldCurve<ZeroYield,Linear>
      PiecewiseYieldCurve<ForwardRate,Linear>
      \endcode
    - Interpolated discount, zero-yield and forward-rate curves can
      now be set any interpolation.
    - FlatForward can now take rates with compounding other than
      continuous.

      Actual365Fixed class.
    - Added dayCounterFromString(std::string) to QuantLibFunctions.

      coefficients of the free direction integers of Lemieux, Cieslak,
      and Luttmer. Coefficients for d<=40 are the same as in
      Bradley-Fox. For dimension 40<d<=360 the coefficients have been
      calculated as optimal values based on the "resolution"
      criterion. The values has been provided by Christiane Lemieux,
      private communication, September 2004.
    - PathGenerator now works correctly with processes describing S

    %QuantLib now depends on the Boost library (www.boost.org).

    You will need a working Boost installation in order to compile and
    use %QuantLib. Instructions for installing Boost from sources are
    available at <http://www.boost.org/more/getting_started.html>.
    Pre-packaged binaries might be available from other sources.
    Google is your friend (or Debian, or Fink...)
