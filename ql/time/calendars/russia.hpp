        Holidays for the Moscow Exchange (MOEX) taken from
        <http://moex.com/s726> and related pages.  These holidays are
        <em>not</em> consistent year-to-year, may or may not correlate
        to public holidays, and are only available for dates since the
        introduction of the MOEX 'brand' (a merger of the stock and
        futures markets).
