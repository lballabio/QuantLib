    //! 30/360 day count convention
    /*! The 30/360 day count can be calculated according to a
        number of conventions.

        US convention: if the starting date is the 31st of a month or
        the last day of February, it becomes equal to the 30th of the
        same month.  If the ending date is the 31st of a month and the
        starting date is the 30th or 31th of a month, the ending date
        becomes equal to the 30th.  If the ending date is the last of
        February and the starting date is also the last of February,
        the ending date becomes equal to the 30th.
        Also known as "30/360" or "360/360".

        Bond Basis convention: if the starting date is the 31st of a
        month, it becomes equal to the 30th of the same month.
        If the ending date is the 31st of a month and the starting
        date is the 30th or 31th of a month, the ending date
        also becomes equal to the 30th of the month.
        Also known as "US (ISMA)".

        European convention: starting dates or ending dates that
        occur on the 31st of a month become equal to the 30th of the
        same month.
        Also known as "30E/360", or "Eurobond Basis".

        Italian convention: starting dates or ending dates that
        occur on February and are greater than 27 become equal to 30
        for computational sake.

        ISDA convention: starting or ending dates on the 31st of the
        month become equal to 30; starting dates or ending dates that
        occur on the last day of February also become equal to 30,
        except for the termination date.  Also known as "30E/360
        ISDA", "30/360 ISDA", or "30/360 German".

        NASD convention: if the starting date is the 31st of a
        month, it becomes equal to the 30th of the same month.
        If the ending date is the 31st of a month and the starting
        date is earlier than the 30th of a month, the ending date
        becomes equal to the 1st of the next month, otherwise the
        ending date becomes equal to the 30th of the same month.
