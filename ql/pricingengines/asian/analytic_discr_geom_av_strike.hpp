        option, with European exercise.  The formula is from "Asian
        Option", E. Levy (1997) in "Exotic Options: The State of the
        Art", edited by L. Clewlow, C. Strickland, pag 65-97

        - the correctness of the returned value is tested by
          reproducing known good results.
