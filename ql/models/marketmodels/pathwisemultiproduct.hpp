    product: it contains the information that would be in the termsheet
    of the product.

    It's useful to have it be able to do several products simultaneously.
    The products would have to have the same underlying rate times of
    course. The class is therefore really encapsulating the notion of a
    multi-product.

    For each time evolved to, it generates the cash flows associated to
    that time for the state of the yield curve. If one was doing a
    callable product then this would encompass the product and its
    exercise strategy.

    This class differs from market-model multi-product in that it also returns the
    derivative of the pay-off with respect to each forward rate
