        It's useful to have it be able to do several products simultaneously.
        The products would have to have the same underlying rate times of
        course. The class is therefore really encapsulating the notion of a
        multi-product.

        For each time evolved to, it generates the cash flows associated to
        that time for the state of the yield curve. If one was doing a
        callable product then this would encompass the product and its
        exercise strategy.
