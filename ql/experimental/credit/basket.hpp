        A basket is a collection of credit names, represented by a
        unique identifier (a text string), associated notional
        amounts, a pool and tranche information. The pool is a map of
        "names" to issuers.  The Basket structure is motivated by CDO
        squared instruments containing various underlying inner CDOs
        which can be represented by respective baskets including their
        tranche structure.  The role of the Pool is providing a unique
        list of relevant issuers while names may appear multiple times
        across different baskets (overlap).
