    //! Analytic pricing engine for double barrier binary options
    /*! This engine implements C.H.Hui series ("One-Touch Double Barrier 
        Binary Option Values", Applied Financial Economics 6/1996), as
        described in "The complete guide to option pricing formulas 2nd Ed", 
        E.G. Haug, McGraw-Hill, p.180

        The Knock In part of KI+KO and KO+KI options pays at hit, while the
        Double Knock In pays at end. 
        This engine thus requires European esercise for Double Knock options, 
        and American exercise for KIKO/KOKI.

        \test
        - the correctness of the returned value is tested by reproducing 
          results available in literature.
