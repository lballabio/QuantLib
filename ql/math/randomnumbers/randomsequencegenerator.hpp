        Class RNG must implement the following interface:
        \code
            RNG::sample_type RNG::next() const;
        \endcode
        If a client of this class wants to use the nextInt32Sequence method,
        class RNG must also implement
        \code
            unsigned long RNG::nextInt32() const;
        \endcode

        \warning do not use with low-discrepancy sequence generator.
