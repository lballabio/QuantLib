    /*! Iterative procedure to compute a correlation matrix reduction to
        a single factor dependence vector by minimizing the residuals.

        It assumes that such a reduction is possible, notice that if the
        dependence can not be reduced to one factor the correlation
        factors might be above 1.

        The matrix passed is destroyed.

        See for instance: "Modern Factor Analysis", Harry H. Harman,
          University Of Chicago Press, 1976. Chapter 9 is relevant to
          this context.
