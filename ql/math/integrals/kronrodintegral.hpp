    //! Integral of a 1-dimensional function using the Gauss-Kronrod methods
    /*! This class provide a non-adaptive integration procedure which
        uses fixed Gauss-Kronrod abscissae to sample the integrand at
        a maximum of 87 points.  It is provided for fast integration
        of smooth functions.

        This function applies the Gauss-Kronrod 10-point, 21-point, 43-point
        and 87-point integration rules in succession until an estimate of the
        integral of f over (a, b) is achieved within the desired absolute and
        relative error limits, epsabs and epsrel. The function returns the
        final approximation, result, an estimate of the absolute error,
        abserr and the number of function evaluations used, neval. The
        Gauss-Kronrod rules are designed in such a way that each rule uses
        all the results of its predecessors, in order to minimize the total
        number of function evaluations.

        points Gauss-Kronrod integration rule.  This is more robust in
        that it allows to integrate less smooth functions (though
        singular functions should be integrated using dedicated
        algorithms) but less efficient beacuse it does not reuse
        precedently computed points during computation steps.
