    /*! THBFIX

    THB interest rate implied by USD/THB foreign exchange swaps

    The Swap Offer Rate represents the cost of
    borrowing a currency synthetically by borrowing USD
    for the same tenor and using the foreign exchange swap
    offer rate on the offer side to swap out the USD in return
    for the foreign currency.

    Fixing is based on average FX Forward rates from 21 banks
    and the USD Libor Fixing.

    Fixing is published at 11:00 am BKK time
