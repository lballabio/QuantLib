    //! Abstract base forward class
    /*! Derived classes must implement the virtual functions
        spotValue() (NPV or spot price) and spotIncome() associated
        with the specific relevant underlying (e.g. bond, stock,
        commodity, loan/deposit). These functions must be used to set the
        protected member variables underlyingSpotValue_ and
        underlyingIncome_ within performCalculations() in the derived
        class before the base-class implementation is called.

        spotIncome() refers generically to the present value of
        coupons, dividends or storage costs.

        discountCurve_ is the curve used to discount forward contract
        cash flows back to the evaluation day, as well as to obtain
        forward values for spot values/prices.

        incomeDiscountCurve_, which for generality is not
        automatically set to the discountCurve_, is the curve used to
        discount future income/dividends/storage-costs etc back to the
        evaluation date.

        \todo Add preconditions and tests

        \warning This class still needs to be rigorously tested
