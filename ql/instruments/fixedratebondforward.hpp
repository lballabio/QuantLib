    //! %Forward contract on a fixed-rate bond
    /*! 1. valueDate refers to the settlement date of the bond forward
           contract.  maturityDate is the delivery (or repurchase)
           date for the underlying bond (not the bond's maturity
           date).

        2. Relevant formulas used in the calculations (\f$P\f$ refers
           to a price):

           a. \f$ P_{CleanFwd}(t) = P_{DirtyFwd}(t) -
              AI(t=deliveryDate) \f$ where \f$ AI \f$ refers to the
              accrued interest on the underlying bond.

           b. \f$ P_{DirtyFwd}(t) = \frac{P_{DirtySpot}(t) -
              SpotIncome(t)} {discountCurve->discount(t=deliveryDate)} \f$

           c. \f$ SpotIncome(t) = \sum_i \left( CF_i \times
              incomeDiscountCurve->discount(t_i) \right) \f$ where \f$
              CF_i \f$ represents the ith bond cash flow (coupon
              payment) associated with the underlying bond falling
              between the settlementDate and the deliveryDate. (Note
              the two different discount curves used in b. and c.)

        \todo Add preconditions and tests

        \todo Create switch- if coupon goes to seller is toggled on,
              don't consider income in the \f$ P_{DirtyFwd}(t) \f$
              calculation.

        \todo Verify this works when the underlying is paper (in which
              case ignore all AI.)

        \warning This class still needs to be rigorously tested
