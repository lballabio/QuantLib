        /*! \warning currently, this method returns the Black-Scholes
                     implied volatility using analytic formulas for
                     European options and a finite-difference method
                     for American and Bermudan options. It will give
                     unconsistent results if the pricing was performed
                     with any other methods (such as jump-diffusion
                     models.)

            \warning options with a gamma that changes sign (e.g.,
                     binary options) have values that are <b>not</b>
                     monotonic in the volatility. In these cases, the
                     calculation can fail and the result (if any) is
                     almost meaningless.  Another possible source of
                     failure is to have a target value that is not
                     attainable with any volatility, e.g., a target
                     value lower than the intrinsic value in the case
                     of American options.
