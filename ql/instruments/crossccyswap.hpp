        Initializes a cross-currency swap with an arbitrary number of legs, each specified

        \param currencies A vector of currencies, one for each leg, specifying the currency
                        in which the corresponding leg's cash flows are denominated.

        \note The sizes of the \p legs, \p payer, and \p currencies vectors must all be equal.
