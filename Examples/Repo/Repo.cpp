/* a Repo calculation done using the FixedRateBondForward class
   cf. aaBondFwd() repo example at
   http://www.fincad.com/support/developerFunc/mathref/BFWD.htm

   This repo is set up to use the repo rate to do all discounting
   (including the underlying bond income). Forward delivery price is
   also obtained using this repo rate. All this is done by supplying
   the FixedRateBondForward constructor with a flat repo
   YieldTermStructure.
