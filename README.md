Contributing
------------

The easiest way to contribute is through pull requests on GitHub.  Get
a GitHub account if you don't have it already and clone the repository
at <https://github.com/lballabio/QuantLib> with the "Fork" button in the
top right corner of the page. Check out your clone to your machine,
code away, push your changes to your clone and submit a pull request;
instructions are available at
<https://help.github.com/articles/fork-a-repo>.  (In case you need
them, more detailed instructions for creating pull requests are at
<https://help.github.com/articles/using-pull-requests>, and a basic
guide to GitHub is at
<https://guides.github.com/activities/hello-world/>.

It's likely that we won't merge your code right away, and we'll ask
for some changes instead. Don't be discouraged! That's normal; the
library is complex, and thus it might take some time to become
familiar with it and to use it in an idiomatic way.

We're looking forward to your contributions.
