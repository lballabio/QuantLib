## Contributing

The preferred way to contribute is through pull requests on GitHub.
Get a GitHub account if you don't have it already and clone the
repository at <https://github.com/lballabio/QuantLib> with the "Fork"
button in the top right corner of the page. Check out your clone to
your machine, code away, push your changes to your clone and submit a
pull request; instructions are available at
<https://help.github.com/articles/fork-a-repo>.

In case you need them, more detailed instructions for creating pull
requests are at
<https://help.github.com/articles/using-pull-requests>, and a basic
guide to GitHub is at
<https://guides.github.com/activities/hello-world/>.  GitHub also
provides interactive learning at <https://lab.github.com/>.

It's likely that we won't merge your code right away, and we'll ask
for some changes instead. Don't be discouraged! That's normal; the
library is complex, and thus it might take some time to become
familiar with it and to use it in an idiomatic way.

We're looking forward to your contributions.
