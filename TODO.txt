upgrade to libXLL

brownian bridge

add stochastic process
set stochastic process to pricing engines
factor out common code of Instruments
do not pass pricing engine to the Instrument constructors
add BET
add CDS


do not distribute html docs with the Win32 installer (chm is already included)
support doc generation from Win32 distribution

GENERAL
- develop a framework for stochastic processes
- merge NesQuant code

DOCUMENTATION
- rewrite and/or update project overview
- add a "Getting started" page to the site for how to approach the library
- draw a road map for future releases
- keep the "to do" list on the site updated (automatically?)
- add a developer blog to the site? A forum where users can leave
  their remarks?
- create a FAQ
- parts of the library badly need some more documentation

UNIT TEST SUITE
* add results of the test suite to web site ((semi-)automatically?) in order
  to give the library some kind of certification
- add covariance/correlation test for SequenceStatistics
- add Gauss-Kronrod test
- add single factor calibration test
- add bermudan (single factor) pricing test
- add quanto, forward and performance forward to test suite

INSTRUMENTS AND GENERAL PRICING ISSUES
- build basic Bond classes
- continuous geometric APO backward starting instead of forward starting
- introduce continuous geometric ASO
- handle backward starting Asian
- IRR, duration, etc for a sequence of cash flows
- implement dividendRho for dividendOption

PRICING ENGINE FRAMEWORK
- design a framework for finite-differences pricing engines
- fix quanto-term-structure/drift-term-structure problem
- create Arguments class not including strike and use it in forward options
- deprecate old pricers whenever new ones are created

MONTE CARLO FRAMEWORK
* number of samples as (n_batches, batch_size)
* use brownian bridge in path generation
- revise multidimensional MonteCarlo
- revise extrapolation in diffusion process
- predictor-corrector scheme
- add example of Martingale control variate
- add examples of Montecarlo internal and Montecarlo convergence
- add Milstein Scheme
- Hypersphere approximation for non positive semi definite correlation
  matrices
- rename MultiPath as MultiAssetPath
- move all (Multi)PathPricer under a folder PathPricers?
- greeks calculation
- introduce compound path pricer?

INTEGRAL PRICING ENGINE FRAMEWORK
- use Gauss-Kronrod algorythm
- tolerance interface

FINITE DIFFERENCE FRAMEWORK
* general review and redesign for pricing engines
* replace all xxAtCenter with more general not "centered" functions
- use DiscretisedAsset instead of array?
- use TimeGrid
- use assetGrid
- allow for time-dependent parameters
- boundary conditions as in Wilmott
- Douglas scheme
- Richardson extrapolation
- SOR rollback for free boundary condition
- clean up FDMultiPeriodOption
- check american with discrete dividends
- merge rollback scheme with tree rollback scheme
- what about barrier or FD with dividends?

LATTICE FRAMEWORK
- Investigate templatization
- BS correction
- merge rollback scheme with FD rollback scheme
- trinomial trees
- implied trinomial trees

VOLATILITY
- investigate extrapolation effect: consider one side differences,
  instead of central, when on the border
- Black surface: check time extrapolation

MATH
* fix cubic spline
* revise the allowExtrapolation thing. Global instead of per-call?
- have Interpolator check for sorted arrays?
- add target value to solver? (now the target value is 0.0)
- clean up accuracy definition in solver1D (x or f(x) accuracy ?)
- add GALib? (genetic algorithm)
- add COOOL algorithms?
- add historical volatility to risk measures
- histogram class

YIELD CURVE
- future convexity adjustment
- end of year turn
- no today date (exogenous)
- no zero/forward assumptions about daycounting and compounding, declare them
   in constructors, specify them in methods
- settle on time measurement. Days (and fraction of days), so that it makes sense whatever the daycount is (workingdays, act/act, etc)?

CURRENCIES
- Currency as class with methods returning related info
- implement currency as per OMG definition

ODDS AND ENDS
- ISDA/FpML
- PRMIA
- update freshmeat description
- get in touch with Gnumeric team
- Louw copyright
- QuantLib dynamic Win32 library (QuantLib.dll)
- implement round as per OMG enumeration/definition
- contact M. Higgings
- check disable warning 4786 better
- && (_MSC_VER >= 1200)
